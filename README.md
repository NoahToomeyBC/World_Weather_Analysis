# Weather Conditions and Travel Itinerary

### In this repo, we have set up a system where the user can add different maximum and minimum temperatures to filter data for potential vacation destinations. Included are also examples of how the script runs and potential outputs for temperatures ranging from 75 to 90 degrees fahrenheit. By utilizing both OpenWeather and Gmaps we were able to generate potential vacation cities as well as an itinerary for people who wish to travel within a specified area.
